# Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery Review

## Description
We have covered a *ton* of material already. Below is a list of JavaScript and jQuery skills that we have developed over the course thus far. Go through the list and write one or two lines of JavaScript to demonstrate your knowledge of each topic. If you spend more than 30 seconds on any give topic, just skip it. Those are the things that you need to work on.
